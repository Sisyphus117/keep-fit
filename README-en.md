- WARN :This summary is generated by AI for I'm strugling writing such a long intro in English at this point. If you find anything wrong about the function or file structure of this project,just ignore it :)

- This file is generated in case you want to have a short brief of what I have done, I swear I made this project 100% manually

- And I promise to add a better README file if time allows

Keep-Fit is a full-stack fitness and nutrition tracking application — a single page application (SPA) front end built in React and a REST API back end built in Node + Express (with Sequelize ORM using MySQL). It supports user registration/login, profile management (including avatar uploads), workout tracking, diet/recipes lookup, and plan management.

## 🚀 Demo

No public demo is available in this repository. You can run the project locally using the steps below.

## 🧭 Tech Stack

- Frontend: React (Vite), JSX, Tailwind CSS
- State management: Redux Toolkit (RTK) — feature slices
- Charts: Recharts
- Build tooling: Vite
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: MySQL (via Sequelize ORM)
- File uploads: Multer (avatar upload to `server/uploads/avatars`)
- Dev tools: Nodemon, ESLint, Prettier

---

## 📂 Architecture Overview

- Frontend (client): A feature-based React app under `client/src`.
  - `client/src/apis/` — API wrappers for calling the server and external services
  - `client/src/features/` — Feature-specific UI components (authentication, fitness, diet, plan, dashboard)
  - `client/src/slices/` — RTK slices for state management
  - `client/src/ui/` — Reusable UI components and layouts
  - `client/src/hooks/` — Custom hooks (auth, debounce, etc.)
- Backend (server): Express app with a routes/controllers/models split under `server/`.
  - `server/routes/` — Routing endpoints for users, workouts, user info, and plans
  - `server/controllers/` — Controller logic for handling API requests
  - `server/models/` — Sequelize models and relations (users, userInfo, workouts, plan)
  - `server/uploads/avatars` — Stored uploaded avatars (publicly served)

Communication: Frontend calls the backend REST API at `SERVER_URL` (development: `http://localhost:3000/`). Client CORS origin is configured in `server/index.js` to `http://localhost:5173`.

## ✅ Key Functionality & Features

- User registration and login
- Profile and avatar upload
- Workout tracking: create, list, delete workouts
- Workout statistics and charts (dashboard)
- Plan management (CRUD for plans)
- Integration with external APIs for BMR, calories burned and recipe searches
- Pagination and sorting utilities for lists

## ⚙️ Development Setup (Local)

Prerequisites:

- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- npm
- MySQL server running locally (default settings shown in `server/database.js` are: database `keepfit_db`, user `root`, password `root`) — adjust if needed.

1. Start the backend server

```powershell
# from repo root
cd server
npm install
# ensure your MySQL server is running and DB is configured
npm run start
```

The server will listen by default on port `3000`.

2. Start the frontend dev server

```powershell
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Default client dev server uses Vite (port `5173`). The server enables CORS for that origin in `server/index.js`.

## 🔌 API Endpoints (overview)

Base URL (development): http://localhost:3000/

Users endpoints:

- GET `/users/id/:id` — fetch user by id
- GET `/users/email/:email` — fetch user by email
- PUT `/users/id/:id` — update user (supports avatar upload with multipart/form-data)
- POST `/users/create` — create new user

User info endpoints:

- GET `/userinfo/id/:id` — fetch profile (user info) for a user
- PUT `/userinfo/id/:id` — update profile
- POST `/userinfo/create` — create profile for user

Workouts endpoints:

- GET `/workouts/id/:id` — workout list for a user
- GET `/workouts/id/:id/today` — workouts for today for a user
- POST `/workouts/create` — add a workout entry
- DELETE `/workouts/id/:id` — delete a workout

Plan endpoints:

- GET `/plan/id/:id` — get plans for user
- POST `/plan/create` — create a plan

Note: The frontend contains wrappers under `client/src/apis/*` that call these endpoints.

## 🛠 Common Development Tasks

- Linting: `cd client && npm run lint`
- Build frontend for production: `cd client && npm run build`
- Preview production build locally: `cd client && npm run preview`

---

## 📁 Database & File Storage

- The server uses Sequelize ORM to connect to MySQL (`server/database.js`), default credentials are `keepfit_db` / `root` / `root`.
- Uploaded avatars are stored under `server/uploads/avatars/` and served via `/uploads` static route.

---

## 🔐 Security & Improvements

- Authentication in code is currently stored and verified using database fields; consider using hashed passwords for production (bcrypt) and JWT/session-based authentication for api protection.
- Move configuration values (DB credentials, API keys, server URL) to environment variables and use dotenv for configuration in production.
- Add validation and rate-limiting, sanitization, tests, and CI/CD pipeline for improved security and reliability.

---

## 🧾 Notes & Caveats

- DB: Create your MySQL DB and run migrations or create tables manually; the project does not include automated migration scripts in the default repository. Example credentials are hard-coded under `server/database.js`.
- Ensure `client/src/utils/constants.js` `SERVER_URL` is updated for the deployed backend (if not running locally on `3000`).

---

## ✍️ Sample Resume Bullet Points

- Implemented a full-stack fitness & nutrition tracking web app using React (Vite), Tailwind and Redux Toolkit for state management, and Node.js + Express with Sequelize ORM for backend APIs.
- Built a modular SPA with a feature-based structure and reusable UI components; integrated external calorie and recipe APIs and implemented file upload (avatar) and static file serving.
- Designed RESTful endpoints and Sequelize models, implemented pagination and sorting, and created a responsive dashboard with Recharts visualizations.

## 💡 Where to go next (suggested improvements)

- Add hashed password storage and authentication flows (sessions or JWT), and secure cookie handling.
- Add CI with GitHub Actions for linting, testing and deploy builds.
- Add seed & migration tooling for consistent DB initialization (Sequelize migrations and seeders).
- Add automated unit and integration tests (Jest / React Testing Library / Supertest).
